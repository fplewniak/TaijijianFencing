<h3 id="taichicaledonia-2016">Taichi Caledonia - Stirling 8-15 July 2016</h3>
<p>It will be a great pleasure for me again to participate to Taichi Caledonia 2016, in Stirling (Scotland) next July. I will propose short "taster" workshops (45 min) on the parallel between Tuishou and Taiji fencing during the week-end, and then a week-long workshop (10 hours) open to all about the Principles of Taiji Swordplay. You will find more details on the <a href="/TCC_2016-Program_w.pdf">full programme</a> and on the <a href="http://www.taichicaledonia.com/">Taichi Caledonia web site</a>.</p>
