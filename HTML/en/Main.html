<h5 id="section-4" class="unnumbered"></h5>
<p>In most styles and schools, Tàijíjiàn is studied quite exclusively as routines and most of the time without much consideration for its martial roots. Although we see now a growing interest in two-person drills, mainly in the form of sticking sword exercises, martial applications are very rarely demonstrated and are often limited to martial explanations and justifications of the routine movements. What may be truly called Tàijíjiàn fencing is even more rarely evoked or practised.</p>
<h5 id="section-5"></h5>
<p>The present work is an attempt to bridge the gap between Tàijí sword form practice and Tàijíjiàn fencing. It is the result of nearly fifteen years of research and experimentation, trying to uncover the martial dimensions of Tàijíjiàn, from fencing basics and martial applications of the form through free sparring with respect for the Tàijí principles. The sources of this work are rooted in the Yángjiā Mìchuán Tàijíjiàn tradition as transmitted by Master Wang Yen-nien, and mainly the Kūnlún sword routine, also known in this style as the <em>Old Sword Form</em>. Historical European fencing from the XIII<sup>th</sup> to the XVIII<sup>th</sup> centuries also provided valuable inspiration. This might seem strange at first sight, but actually, European fencing treatises of past centuries do remind sometimes of our Tàijí classics and a good deal of European techniques present striking similarities to those found in Tàijí sword forms. In particular, applying to the Kūnlún routine form the concept of <em>fencing phrase</em> which describes fencing actions as if it were a conversation, allowed me to discover convincing martial applications for most movements of this form. In all those cross-cultural experimentations though, my guides have always been the Tàijí principles, Tàijí classics and Master Wang Yen-nien’s precepts. I did not have the luck to be a direct student of Master Wang, however his books and my notes from the few workshops I could attend contain a wealth of enlightening information. I also owe my teachers, who had been his direct students and truthfully transmitted his teachings, an immense debt of gratitude. I do believe therefore that the sword techniques and notions you will find in these pages can confidently be considered as appropriate Tàijí sword techniques, respectful of principles, even though some may have been elucidated thanks to unrelated but nonetheless convergent sources.</p>
<h5 id="section-6" class="unnumbered"></h5>
<p>This is still a work in progress and in constant evolution. I do not pretend to hold the absolute truth nor to have succeeded in reconstructing genuine historically accurate Tàijí sword techniques. Actually, I do not care, this was not my goal. The only thing that really matters to me is how this work can help improving Tàijíjiàn practice and the comprehension of Tàijí principles. Today, I have the feeling that this work is consistent at last and worth sharing with all those interested no matter the style they practice.</p>
<h5 id="section-7" class="unnumbered"></h5>
<p>As I considered publishing my work, doing so for free in the form of a web site soon became self-evident. It would ensure a wide diffusion while at the same time avoid all the hassle of book printing. Another important reason was that, before you can actually appear in print, you have to write the book from beginning to end first. A web site, on the opposite, can start with partial content and may be easily updated and augmented gradually with new material. Last but not least, a web site would allow better integration of various media such as video. However, since off-line reading might be desirable sometimes, downloadable versions will also be made available in epub and PDF formats. The choice of the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND licence was also an evident response to the same concerns.

<h1 id="ch:chinesesword">The Chinese sword</h1>
<p>Swords can be generally defined as edged weapons used for cutting or thrusting, with a long blade, a handle and a guard that may protect the hand. There is archaeological evidence of the use of swords dating back as far as the Bronze Age, both in the Mediterranean world and in China. From these early times to the beginning of the XX<sup>th</sup> century when they ceased to be used for combat, swords have evolved in parallel with fighting techniques. Fencing techniques of a particular historical period were adapted to the type of sword available at the time, and symmetrically, sword shape was gradually amended to better serve these techniques, eventually giving birth to new types. We will focus here exclusively on the Chinese straight sword, or Jiàn that was in use during the period when Tàijíjiàn was effectively used in combat.</p>
<h2 id="from-the-battle-field-to-the-public-park">From the battle field to the public park</h2>
<p>I will not get deep into historical considerations about Chinese swordsmanship. Other authors who are more knowledgeable on the subject have already published works more accurate and extensive than anything I could write here.</p>
<p>Though there is to my knowledge no written mention of a martial art called Tàijíquán before the XIX<sup>th</sup> century, the Tàijí principles had certainly been around for quite a long time when they were gathered into a whole coherent martial system by the Chen family of Cheng Jiagou and later on formalised by scholars in the classic texts. It is generally admitted that it emerged and developed between the XVIII<sup>th</sup> and XIX<sup>th</sup> centuries, during the ??? dynasty. The Yángjiā Mìchuán style, root of the present work, was created by Yang Luchan in mid-XIX<sup>th</sup> century after, it is said, he had been a disciple of Chen …</p>
<p>Tàijíjiàn, the swordsmanship based on the same Tàijí principles as Tàijíquán, naturally adopted the kind of straight swords that were being currently used during this period in China. In historical times, there had never been any such thing as a sword specifically tailored for . However, when swords were superseded by firearms and less ostentatious weapons at the turn of the XX<sup>th</sup> century, and as martial arts were becoming sports or disciplines for personal development and health, swords were adapted to these new needs. The sword types of the ??? dynasty were definitively adopted as the standard Tàijí practice sword. However, they were nonetheless gradually ripped off some of their properties that had been crucial to their effective use in combat but were not required any more or might even be an hindrance to demonstrative use.</p>
<p>Most practice swords today are only distantly related to the real weapons that were still in practical use when traditional <span>Tàijíjìan</span> routines were created. Most modern replicas designed for practice are indeed very light and have an extremely flexible blade, their balance is adequate for easy control and moves but they would not stand the challenge of sword fighting.</p>
<p>It is possible though to find good replicas having an appropriate balance and I can assure you that with such swords, all the details of all moves in the form are simply evident when performed at full speed. Therefore, in order to really understand the martial aspects of traditional forms of <span>Tàijíjìan</span>, I am convinced of the importance to refer to the characteristics of the <span>Jìan</span> sword types of this period.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-the-jìan">Anatomy of the <span>Jìan</span></h2>
<p>The <span>Jìan</span> is composed of a straight blade extended by a tang around which are fixed, a guard, a handle or hilt, and a pommel.</p>
<p><embed src="../../Images/EmptyFig.pdf" /> [fig:sword<sub>p</sub>arts]</p>
<h3 id="sword-dimensions">Sword dimensions</h3>
<p>Though there may have been smaller ones, the typical length of this type of sword is around 90 to 95 cm including 70 to 75 cm for the blade. Their weight ranges from around 700 g to about 1 kg, and is generally close to 900 g.</p>
<h3 id="the-blade">The blade</h3>
<p>The blade of the <span>Jìan</span> is straight, with two cutting edges that are nearly parallel to each other, with only a very gentle taper along the whole length of the blade: from about 3 or 4 cm at its base, the blade’s width is reduced to roughly 2 or 3 cm near the tip.</p>
<p>The traditional section of the blade has the shape of an apple seed.</p>
<p>this shape of the section protects the edge edge must be hard steel to cut efficiently and stay sharp but hard steel is brittle and may break therefore three layers of steel: hard steel between two cheeks of soft steel thus edge can be sharp yet protected and the blade be flexible enough for not breaking with shocks balance between flexibility and sharpness good blade should be elastic indeed: vibration under shocks that limit the risks of breaking the blade, absorb energy from shocks. elasticity and vibration node, node in the handle reduce the transmission of vibration to the hand elasticity but not too flexible if too flexible, prevent from transmitting pressure, to be not too flexible, require some minimal thickness but the thicker the blade the heavier the sword, and possibly, if the blade is too heavy then the sword is not properly balanced. groove role is to reduce the weight of the blade while maintaining its strength H-shaped not for blood or avoid suction, this is a legend. the proof is that sabres and other cutting swords have one, and thrusting swords do not. groove often not along the whole length, only in the two thirds of the blade from its base (check this) and therefore would be of no use that far from the tip, and anyway, why use is the groove far from the tip: the blade should not be pushed that far, an the groove would not be useful there but nonetheless difficult to make.</p>
<h3 id="the-tang">The tang</h3>
<p>The tang is the part of the blade that extends into the handle. It should as thick and wide as possible to reduce its fragility. tangs have a square section and fit perfectly within the hilt. Symmetrically, the hole in the handle square shaped and not round so as to fit the tang. Otherwise, the tang may turn inside the handle and possibly damage it. real swords the tang is riveted to the pommel and sometimes to the hilt.</p>
<h3 id="the-guard">The guard</h3>
<p>Its role is to protect the hand holding the sword. It has a width of about 10 cm for a length of 5 cm and a thickness of 3 to 4 cm. The guard is open towards the front where the base of the sword is fixed and is made of hollow metal, usually tin.</p>
<p>There are different styles of guards. The one I like the most is the backward guard, which is typical of the Qing dynasty, the period which, as far as I know, saw the development of <span>Tàijíjìan</span> as a applied martial discipline. Although it may not be obvious, this guard offers a very efficient protection to the hand when the sword is held properly. This backward guard avoids to involuntarily block the opponent’s blade as the forward style does sometimes if the sides of the guard stick out too much forward and parallel to the blade.</p>
<h3 id="the-hilt">The hilt</h3>
<p>The hilt is spindle-shaped a shape particularly adapted to the palm.</p>
<p>It is generally made of wood. In order to avoid the grip to slip, the hilt is sometimes covered by a string or leather or ray skin for the most expensive ones</p>
<h3 id="the-pommel">The pommel</h3>
<p>The pommel has an important role in the sword’s balance. It is important to note that this role is not as important for the static balance as it is for the dynamic balance of the sword. If the pommel participates to the position of the centre of gravity (COG) this is not its essential role. It is indeed possible to achieve a proper position of the COG by simply adjusting the relative weights of the blade and the guard, including some exaggerated tapper of the blade, nearly without any help from the pommel. In this case though, the sword would not behave satisfactorily, and in particular, would not whirl swiftly. On the other hand, a heavier pommel favours sword rotations by counterbalancing the weight of the blade during whirls. The weight of the pommel is therefore a compromise between achieving swiftness and positioning the COG properly.</p>
<h2 id="balance-and-dynamic-properties">Balance and dynamic properties</h2>
<p>Centre of gravity Pivot point The COG should not be to close to the guard indeed. A good distance is about 10 to 15 cm or so in the front of the guard. A more distant COG would make the sword clumsy, especially when thrusting while a closer one would result in a sluggish sword that must be fully directed instead of having its own life.</p>
<p>The COG is not all what it is to a good sword’s balance. Dynamic properties are even more essential. These can only be achieved by the appropriate repartition of masses along the sword. Thus, the thickness of the blade, the presence of gutters, the weight of the blade, the guard and the pommel must be properly adjusted to create the appropriate pivot points and achieve a proper dynamic balance.</p>
<p>Pivot points are natural centres of rotation relative to the point where the sword is held. To find the pivot point of a sword, hold it lightly by the hilt between the thumb and the forefinger, at the place you normally grip your sword and wave the handle sideways. The point of the blade that does not move is the pivot point relative to the place of the handle you were holding the sword. This point should be somewhere around the third of the blade length from the tip.</p>
<p>Note that the pivot point is not absolute and depends on the position of the grip. It is therefore essential that the grip is properly placed on the handle to achieve a correct dynamic balance of the sword.</p>
<p>A cut hitting its target exactly at the pivot point will go through easily without any strain. Hitting further to the tip will tend to make the handle go forward and slash somehow. The effect of hitting close to the tip is not that noticeable though, which is a reason why it is said that the third part of the blade from the point should be used for cutting. Furthermore, when cutting with this part of the blade, the natural movement of the sword will help performing a fast and light yet powerful cut. Hitting closer to the guard, on the other hand, will tend to push the hilt against the hand. The blow will be strong, with a good connexion to the body structure but somewhat less adapted to a fast cut although a cut with this part of the blade could nonetheless be deadly. The superior structure makes it more suitable to controls of the opponent’s blade though.</p>

<p>This chapter will discuss the various aspects of Tàijíjiàn practice, from basic exercises and solo form, to free sparring including considerations on security.</p>
<h1 id="ch:grip">Sword handling</h1>
<h5 id="section-9" class="unnumbered"></h5>
<p>In Chinese culture, swordsmanship and calligraphy are considered as intimately related arts. It is commonly said indeed that a sword should be handled as if it were a calligraphy brush. This statement will be clear to everyone has tried one’s hand at Chinese calligraphy: in order to achieve a proper control of the strokes, the brush must be held firmly yet not too tightly so as to be connected to the centre of the calligrapher’s body. Any weakness or stiffness in the way the brush is handled will result in angular or wobbly strokes.</p>
<p>Similarly, when wielding a sword, a weak or stiff grip will hinder the fluidity of movements and the proper connection between the sword and the body, invariably resulting in clumsy and lifeless movements of the sword. In swordplay, an improper grip precludes sensing, adapting and reacting efficiently to the opponent’s movements.</p>
<p>Since the way the hilt is gripped determines how tractable the sword is, an appropriate grip with the right alignment and a tensionless attitude are essential to achieve a good unity with the sword.</p>
<h2 id="the-sword-grip">The sword grip</h2>
<p>Of all the types of grips I experimented, I strongly recommend the one shown in figure [fig:grip] for both routine practice and swordplay.</p>
<p>To take this grip, align your tiger’s mouth, wrist and forearm with the blade then wrap your fingers around the middle part of the handle, between the two ferrules. The thumb and the middle finger lock the grip at the very centre of the handle. Both the index and little fingers remain free and participate to the precise control of the hilt position in the hand or allow loosening or tightening the grip.</p>
<p>As shown in figure [fig:alignment], the wrist, elbow and shoulder are aligned in the plane of the blade. This ensures that the sword is firmly rooted in the hand and that a good connection is achieved between the centres of the sword and the body, a prerequisite for efficient absorption and expression without tension nor strain on joints, muscles and sinews. Furthermore, in this position, the elbow lies within the protective range of the guard and thus is less exposed to quick blows.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the grip may be adjusted to perform a particular technique, but when doing so, it is most important that much attention is paid not to heedlessly weaken nor stiffen the grip. In any case, when the circumstances are not favourable for changing grip, which is often the case in free sparring, it is highly recommended to keep on with the main grip described above.</p>
<p>The sword mobility is also controlled by tightening or loosening the grip. It should be reminded though that no finger should ever fully release the handle: even when whirling the sword, all fingers should always maintain some control on the handle.</p>
<p>I am convinced that it is crucial to refrain from holding the handle next to the guard, even if the sword would feel less heavy this way because of the grip being closer to the sword’s centre of gravity.</p>
<p>First of all, when the hand is at the centre of the hilt, the spindle-shaped handle fits the palm nicely and, as the guard and pommel are further away from the hand, they do not hinder sword movements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chinese guards being very narrow they do not wrap fully around the hand as the rapier’s shell does and do not provide as much protection to the hand. However, if the grip is centred on the handle, the thumb and the forefinger are further away from the opponent’s edge when controlling his blade and thus, are less exposed to accidental cuts than they would be with the hand next to the guard.</p>
<p>Finally, on a well-balanced sword, the centre of rotation resulting from a centred grip is precisely at the right location to enable the pommel to fully play its role in the sword dynamic balance<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, ensuring swift and lively sword movements that can really make a difference in swordplay.</p>
<h2 id="the-sword-fingers">The sword fingers</h2>
<p>The hand posture known as the <em>sword fingers</em> or <em>sword talisman</em> is definitely emblematic of Chinese straight sword practice and particularly of Tàijíjiàn. In its traditional version shown in figure [fig:swordfingers], the index and medium fingers are extended while the thumb, the ring and little fingers are connected to form a circle. Some practitioners also use a more relaxed version where the thumb, the ring and little fingers are simply relaxed without assuming the form of a closed circle.</p>
<p><embed src="../../Images/SwordFingers/SwordFingers1.pdf" /> [fig:swordfingers]</p>
<p>The main role of the sword fingers is to create a spiral connecting the tip of the middle finger to the point of the blade and balancing the weight and movements of the sword. This spiral is generated by stretching the left arm forward in a direction parallel to the line that passes through both tips of the extended fingers.</p>
<p>Although the spiral is effective with both the traditional and relaxed forms, the more constrained traditional one draws the attention more readily to the left side than does the relaxed version.</p>
<p>When beginners hold a sword, their mind is strongly focussed on the sword and their right hand. Very often, the other side of the body is left completely unattended unless they pay great attention to maintaining a proper sword fingers hand shape. It is therefore important that beginners do not overlook the sword fingers. It is only when they have gained sufficient experience and the balancing spiral has become natural that they may start using the relaxed form.</p>
<h2 id="wielding-the-sword">Wielding the sword</h2>
<p>It is often repeated that the sword should be an extension of the body and that the practitioners should make one with their sword. Although this may seem quite clear, it is far from being evident in practice. First of all, the sword should be considered as an extra segment of the arm with the grip playing the role of an additional joint. Like any other joint, the grip should therefore be relaxed and moving in unison with the whole body, allowing the sword to move freely in the hand.</p>
<p>If unity with the sword is purposed indeed, the sword nonetheless has its own individuality and its own particular way of responding to the practitioner’s movements that depends on its physical characteristics. It is therefore indispensable that the sword’s individual demeanour should be acknowledged in order to blend harmoniously its movements with those of the practitioner.</p>
<p>This is somehow similar to dancing: a good dancer does not merely impose steps on his partner but is constantly aware of her position and thus is able to adapt to her moves and gently lead her to take the appropriate steps for the next figure. The same stands when wielding a sword. Movements should not be imposed on the sword but the sword should be guided towards the appropriate direction to achieve the desired technique. In return, the practitioner’s movements and steps are guided by the sword’s weight and impetus: if the sword is an extension of the body indeed, the body is nonetheless an extension of the sword...</p>
<p>There is a constant two-way exchange between the sword and the practitioner that is most apparent in routine practice but is no less important in free play. Thus, even a rather heavy sword may be wielded effectively and swiftly with only a minimum of physical strength involved, the momentum of each movement being recovered and recycled into the next one.</p>
<p>The energy required to perform the techniques is provided by the weight and momentum of the sword itself combined with the right impulse from the body at the appropriate time. Thanks to inertia, the sword’s centre of gravity, borne along by the sword’s momentum, acts as a fulcrum to allow increasing the speed of the tip or pointing it to another direction. In free play, pressures exerted voluntarily or not by the opponent on the blade may also be absorbed, assimilated and transformed to generate attacks and ripostes.</p>
<p>To make a long story short we will conclude by saying that the energy is rooted in the hilt, controlled by the sword’s centre and expressed in the blade.</p>
<h1 id="ch:jianfa">The Jìbĕn Jiànfă</h1>
<p>This chapter will present the Jìbĕn Jiànfă — the nine basic sword techniques — of the Yángjiā Mìchuán Tàijíjiàn tradition. It is expected though that this chapter may nonetheless apply, at least in part, to other styles.</p>

<h1 id="ch:stepping">Stepping</h1>
<p>This chapter will discuss the stepping in Tàijíjiàn.</p>
<h1 id="ch:distancetime">Time and Distance</h1>
<p>Like for any martial art, time and distance are most essential notions to fencing. It is only by mastering them that one may hope to become a truly proficient fencer.</p>
<p>Intricately intertwined, these two concepts are not absolute nor fixed notions though and bear all but no relation with actual physical dimensions. While they do help describing and objectively commenting fencing actions, they also encompass the sense of time and distance in a context of confrontation, that is to say the perception that the opponents have of their relative capacities of action. As such, time and distance are central to fencing tactics and strategy.</p>
<h2 id="fencing-time">Fencing time</h2>
<p><em>Fencing time</em> is a unit of time defined as the duration of a simple action: a step, a cut, a thrust, a parry, etc. The number of time units taken by a combined action is the number of consecutive simple actions that compose it, simultaneous simple actions counting for one unit of time only. For example, one step while parrying followed by a riposte would sum up to two time units in all.</p>
<p>Fencing time is not related to actual clock time, it is not a definite span of time since the actual duration of a simple action will depend upon the speed at which it is executed. Fencing time is rather related to the notion of commitment in an action associated with an underlying intent. As long as the fencer is not fully engaged in his action, he may still transform and change his intent during the same unit of time. It is only after full commitment that it becomes impossible to interrupt the course of the ongoing action and change one’s mind during the same fencing time. This does not mean though that an action must necessarily be led to its term as soon as it has been initiated but that transformations take more time when the intention is fully engaged.</p>
<p>This very important tactical notion is used in feints and false attacks. As we shall see further, when feinting, full commitment is not sought but the fake strike must be convincing enough to compel the opponent to get fully involved in parrying what he thinks to be an attack. It is then possible to modify our initial action during the same time and launch the true attack while the opponent, sticking to his first reaction, is baffled. As a general rule, it should be avoided to engage in action too early so as to preserve for as long as possible a capacity to transform and adapt effectively to the opponent’s reactions.</p>
<p>Fencing time may thus be seen as a useful theoretical notion for assessing the fencers’ current ability for initiative, transformation or response during actions. It helps to formalise the course of simple actions when studying a <em>phrase d’arme</em>, no matter how fast or slow it is performed and assuming that both opponents are equally fast. Of course, in real life, some fencers are faster than others but actually, speed does not matter. Only tempo is important: what really counts is the right action at the right time. It is always possible to compensate for a lesser speed with the effective use of techniques and tactics, and above all, by mastering rhythm. A faster fencer may loose his advantage if he is forced by a proficient opponent to use more fencing times for his actions. This is sometimes adopted as a strategy by some fencers who keep their opponent in a constant state of urgency while allowing themselves to take their time. Whether they do so by maintaining a permanent threat against their opponent or by always stepping out of his lines of attack, they impose their own rhythm on the fight and do not allow their opponent to regain the initiative. To achieve this goal however, it is essential for them to stay connected to their opponent and that every single move and menace perfectly fits his reactions. In other words, the rhythm of the fight is actually a combination of the rhythms of both opponents. Although, the rhythm of one fencer may take precedence over the other’s it never does so independently: connection and relationship are essential.</p>
<p>The ability to grasp and match the rhythm of our opponent while concealing our own is therefore fundamental to seize the right moment and gain an advantage. It is essential to maintain a constant awareness of the opponent’s moves and not to get trapped into heedless anticipation by misleading regular rhythm patterns. Great care should be paid too not to embrace too regular a rhythm that would consequently be easily predictable by the opponent. Controlling rhythm does imply a relaxed state of mind ensuring we are constantly ready to adapt to the situation and transform it to our advantage by responding to the opponent’s moves unexpectedly. More than quick reactions though haste should not be mistaken for speed this is definitely a question of being on the edge of a perpetual present, letting the past flow away and the future happen without clinging to any premeditated technique.</p>
<h2 id="distance-and-measure">Distance and measure</h2>
<p>Just as fencing time does not actually represent an objective span of time, the effect of the distance between the two opponents on their respective ability to strike each other is more important here than their actual distance. We thus define measure as the distance range within which it is possible to hit the opponent in one fencing time. In other words, it is a distance close enough for not requiring more than one step to strike. If at least two steps are necessary, we are said to be out of measure.</p>
<p>On this basis, three in-measure distances may be defined:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Guard distance</em> or <em>long measure</em>: one step is required for striking. This is the most usual distance in free play as it offers a good compromise between a protective attitude and a more pressing one.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reach distance</em> or <em>short measure</em>: at this distance, it is possible to strike with the appropriate section of the blade without having to step forward nor backward.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Close distance</em>: this distance is too short to use the blade effectively, only close combat techniques can be used such as kicking, punching, grappling, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But there is much more to measure than distance. Measure is influenced indeed by the fencers’ stances and their respective angles of attack. The guard and foot position determine the range that can be covered by the sword during one fencing time with simple actions: step, weight transfer, arm and body rotation. Whether the target being aimed at actually lies or not within this range and may be reached in one time by an effective cut or thrust will in turn mainly depend upon the angle of attack and the opponent’s cover.</p>
<p>It should be reminded that both the angle of attack and the sword’s range must be considered here not only in the horizontal plane but in three dimensions, the longest distance being attained with the arm fully extended horizontally at shoulder level. Thus, in any situation, the closest targets are those approximately lying at shoulder’s height, that is, most of the time, the upper chest and the throat. Lower targets may be reached by stepping forward but also by crouching or leaning so as to lower the shoulder down to target level.</p>
<p>Figure [fig:distance<sub>s</sub>tance] shows how the sword’s range is affected by the fencer’s stance and stepping as well as by the height of the target.</p>
<p><embed src="../../Images/DistanceTime/distance_stance.pdf" /> [fig:distance<sub>s</sub>tance]</p>
<p>Fencing being dynamic by nature, measure must be further accounted for in an ever changing context and may vary dramatically with every single move of the opponents. As stepping away from the target increases distance, one may be close enough to be statically in measure, but may be at the same time out of measure if evaluated dynamically. The combination of time and distance reduces or increases the relative duration of of fencing of fencing time units for each opponent depending on whether their steps bring them closer to or further from their target.</p>
<p>The concept of measure is not symmetrical indeed and the opponents are not necessarily within the same measure relatively to each other due to different stances, relative moves or respective angles of attack. A fencer may thus leverage the asymmetry of measure by stepping towards a direction and from an angle that would dynamically keep his opponent out of measure while simultaneously allowing himself to hit.</p>
<p>This is actually a key to efficient Tàijí fencing: the opponent is overcome by the appropriate move at the appropriate time and distance, not by a greater speed. The principles are respected and the fencer’s moves can thus be calm and his mind serene. It is therefore fundamental to develop an ability to instantly perceive one’s own measure as well as the capacity of the opponent to hit so as to constantly adapt to the opponent’s moves and strike him on the spot when it is possible to do so while keeping away from his threat.</p>
<h2 id="drills-and-exercises">Drills and exercises</h2>
<p>The following drills and exercises will allow you to apprehend and practice the sense of distance and time.</p>
<h3 id="still-target">Still target</h3>
<p>This drill is adapted from the one called <em>tirer au mur</em> in western fencing. It consists in aiming thrusts or cuts at a non-moving target.</p>
<p>Take place in front of the target at a long-measure distance, draw a thrust or a cut at the target with one step.</p>
<p>Repeat this drill starting from various foot positions until you have a good grasp of the long measure in all stances.</p>
<p>Then, you may try yourself at the dynamic version of this drill. Instead of starting directly in measure, start now from a longer distance requiring more than one step to bring you in short measure. Approach and strike at the target without interruption, while stepping.</p>
<p>Practise this drill slowly at first and increase your speed gradually, but do not go faster as long as you need to reduce your speed or mark a stop before aiming at the target. The goal here is to acquire the capacity to evaluate the distance while approaching the target and hit as soon as you are at the appropriate distance.</p>
<p>To increase difficulty, you may also vary the angles of attack and approach in sinuous lines.</p>
<p>Ideally, in order to avoid hard shocks and account for penetration of the blade, the target should yield to hits. Clothes-pegs on a clothes-line hung at throat level make pretty suitable targets in this regard.</p>
<h3 id="moving-target">Moving target</h3>
<p>This drill is adapted from Olivier Delannoy. It should be practised with secured blades exclusively and the partner holding the target should at least wear a fencing mask. You will also need a portable target such as a wooden plank with handles, a table tennis racket or a boxing pad.</p>
<p>The partner holding the target moves around facing the partner carrying the sword, keeping the target turned toward the floor. The latter follows the stepping of the former, trying to stay in measure. The target holder may raise the target at any time. At this signal, his partner must draw a thrust at the target if he is at the appropriate distance.</p>
<p>With a boxing pad or a racket, it is also possible to practice this drill with cuts.</p>
<h3 id="double-threat">Double threat</h3>
<p>This exercise should be practised very slowly with secured blades and fencing masks. Full protective gear would be required should the partners decide to play faster.</p>
<p>One partner assumes any stance or guard that may please him and his two partners take a threatening position in measure.</p>
<p>The first partner must then find a way to evade the threats and stay out of the measure of both his partners while hitting at least one of them.</p>
<p>Both threatening partners should stay still for the whole duration of the exercise. However, in a variant of this drill, they may move slowly, at the same pace as the first partner, to check he really is at a safe distance.</p>
<p>The partners should always take their time in this exercise so as to be able to analyse the situation and practice safely.</p>
<p>This exercise may be practised with more than three partners.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-attackers">Multiple attackers</h3>
<p>This exercise should be performed imperatively with secured blades and full protective gear.</p>
<p>One partner must defend against the continuous attacks from several partners. His goal is to deal with as many successive attacks as he can.</p>
<p>Each attack must be launched as soon as the defender has parried the previous one and riposted, but not before.</p>
<p>Attackers should fully engage in their attacks and not try to adapt to the defender’s parries.</p>
<p>When responding to an attack, the defender must keep control of his distance to other attackers in order to maintain them out of measure and thus ensure he has enough time to react to their attacks.</p>
<h1 id="ch:lines">The lines</h1>
<p>This chapter will discuss the concept of lines in fencing.</p>
<p>There are four lines referring to the position of the blade relative to the opponent’s sword while engaging, attacking or parrying: inside, outside, above or below.</p>
<h1 id="ch:guards">The guards</h1>
<p>A guard is any posture that may be used to protect oneself while preparing an attack.</p>
<p>This chapter will present the nine guards that can be identified in the Yángjiā Mìchuán Tàijíjiàn Kūnlún sword form. These guards are not part of the traditional transmission. They are postures frequently encountered in the form that may correspond to the above definition of a guard.</p>
<h1 id="ch:sparring">Free sparring</h1>
<p>This chapter will discuss the various aspects of free sparring, including technical, tactical and strategic considerations.</p>
<h1 id="ch:applications">Martial applications</h1>
<p>This chapter will present a selection of martial application from the Kūnlún sword routine of the Yángjiā Mìchuán Tàijíjiàn tradition. These applications will be selected as illustrations of the concepts discussed in other chapters.</p>
<h1 id="ch:classics">The Tàijí classics</h1>
<p>The Tàijí classics are texts written at the end of the XIX<sup>th</sup> century and composing a corpus common to all styles of Tàijíquán.</p>
<p>This chapter will, within the scope of fencing, discuss the principles of Tàijí described in these text and that will be developed further in the following chapters.</p>
<h1 id="ch:transformation">Fluidity and transformation</h1>
<p>Fluidity and transformation are fundamental notions in Tàijíquán and therefore in Tàijíjiàn. They result from the application of principles described in the Classics such as relaxation, understanding the Yīn/Yáng, etc.</p>
<h1 id="ch:jing">The Jing energies</h1>
<p>This chapter will discuss the different Jing energies: Ding jing, Dong jing, Hua jing and Fa jing.</p>
<h1 id="ch:siyao">The Sì Yāo</h1>
<p>This chapter will present the Sì Yāo (Zhan, Nian, Lian, Sui) considered from a fencing point of view…</p>
<h1 id="ch:yi">The Yì</h1>
<p>This chapter will present the various aspects of Yì in Tàijíjiàn from routine practice to free sparring…</p>
