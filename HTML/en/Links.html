<h3 id="where">Where to practise Tàijíjiàn?</h3>

<p>If after reading these pages, you want to practise Tàijíjiàn fencing, here is a selection of links you may start with:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>You will be more than welcome to join us at <a href="http://taiji.archipel.free.fr/">ARCHIPEL</a>. This Tàijí association located in Strasbourg offers weekly classes in both Tàijí sword form and fencing.</li>

<li><a href="http://aramis72.taichi.free.fr/">ARAMIS</a> was the first Tàijí group, beside ARCHIPEL, to trust in my work. They regularly invite me to share my experience during week-end workshops and now also offer a weekly Tàijí sword class, including partner work.</li>

<li><a href="http://compagnonsdutaiji.weebly.com/">Les Compagnons du Tàijí</a> is an association based in Angers. I enjoy a special relationship with their sword instructor who is giving weekly classes in Tàijíjiàn, including partner work.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.lotusenergy.fr/">Lotus Energy</a> regularly proposes mini-workshops in the area of Hérépian when you may follow classes on the principles of Taijijian, including partner exercises.</li>

<li>Do not miss <a href="http://jeuxepee.over-blog.com/">Jeux d'épée (Sword play)</a> a one-of-its-kind summer camp, open to all, where you may practise partner work with a variety of weapons for three days.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You will find more Yángjiā Mìchuán associations in Europe on the site of the <a href="http://www.amicale-yangjia-michuan-tjq.org/?q=en">Yángjiā Mìchuán Tàijíquán Amicale</a>. I am not aware of all those that may offer classes in Tàijíjiàn partner work and fencing so you will have to contact them directly if you are interested.</p>

<p>In the USA, the only group proposing Tàijíjiàn fencing classes I am aware of is the <a href="http://www.grtc.org/">Great River Taoist Center</a>, although there  are probably others as well.</a></p>

<p>Beside Yángjiā Mìchuán, Swedish practitioners may join <a href="http://jianfa.se/">Historisk Fäktning i Linköping</a>.</p>


<h3 id="where">Where to buy fencing gear?</h3>
<p>Except for sparring swords, specific equipment for Tàijíjiàn fencing does not exist for the moment. You will need to do with fencing gear designed for Historical European Martial Arts.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Sparring Swords</strong> we use in our group are those produced by <a href="https://www.regenyei.com/en_index.php">Regenyei Armory</a>. Their <a href="https://www.regenyei.com/en_sp_otherweapon1.php">Jian Sword</a> with a perfect weight and balance, is really an excellent blade for partner drills and sparring, as well as for solo practice.
<li>You may also have a look at the <a href="https://www.paulchenhanweiswords.com/sparring-jian/">Paul Chen Hanwei Sparring Jian</a>.
<li>If your are on a budget though, the <a href="http://www.dragonsports.eu/en/tai-ji-tai-chi-straightsword-upper-range-rigid-p-11510.html">rigid Taiji Straight Swords</a>  from <a href="http://www.dragonsports.eu">Dragon sport</a>.  could make a good compromise, with a reasonable weight and quite an appropriate balance. <strong>Beware!!!</strong> Those blades have very thin edges and a sharp point; they are quite dangerous if wielded heedlessly. Use them with great caution and at your own risks.</li>
<li><strong>Fencing masks</strong> and <strong>gloves</strong> can be purchased from <a href="http://www.faitsdarmes.com">Faits d'armes</a> or <a href="https://www.theknightshop.com/">The Knight Shop</a>. Note that The Knight Shop also sells plastic swords for Historical European Martial Arts. These are definitely not Chinese swords, but, after some modifications, their <a href="https://www.theknightshop.com/single-hand-synthetic-sparring-arming-sword">single-hand sword</a> should be suitable for free sparring but the plastic blades are slippery and have rounded edges that make it difficult to feel blade contact.</li>
<li><a href="http://histfenc.com/">SPES</a> is a web shop committed in selling <strong>protective gear</strong> for historical fencing. Their <a href="http://histfenc.com/productcart/ap-fencing-jacket-350n">Axel Pettersson Fencing Jacket</a> and <a href="http://histfenc.com/productcart/ap-womens-fencing-jacket-350n">its Women's version</a> offer a good protection of the torso combined with excellent mobility.</li>
</ul>
